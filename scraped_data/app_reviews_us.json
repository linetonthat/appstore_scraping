Once he was born I became more interested in what all the AQI apps actually did and started researching them. AirVisual is by far the best one I have come across (having used 10+ different apps). Not only can you choose to use the US index (which I would highly recommend) you also can see which pollutants are contaminating the atmosphere at any given time. I also have a laser egg (also highly recommended) which is a portable particulate counter and the readings on my mobile device and the closest monitoring station on the app are always within +/-20 meaning they are not contradicting each other. On other apps there would often times be a 50 point+ difference between what my particulate counter read and the other random apps I was using. Also, do note that some apps do, like airvisual, have the different pollutants listed and their levels but airvisual is the only app I have found that combines that with the ability to choose the US AQI standard. My go-to app when it comes to air pollution."},

Since the 1970\u2019s I\u2019ve been personally interested in my home environment mainly because 3 of my family members, my husband & 2 children have hay fever in the Spring. We installed an electronic air filter in our furnace and air conditioning system which seemed to help immensely. \n\nFat forward another 30+ years when we discovered the AirVisual app & their small device that could monitor our indoor air quality. Yes, using an AirVisual device is an easy way to monitor and improve your own air quality in your home. I discovered that NOT opening the windows to bring in a little fresh air was bad for us. Our carbon dioxide CO2 levels were getting in a higher range and causing headaches and lethargic behaviors. Being retired and at home most of the time, this became even more important to monitor our indoor AQI. Thank you AirVisual for providing the tools and information for a healthier lifestyle. \ud83e\udd70"},

I have not yet come across intrusive tracking, data collection or advertising; it's not necessary to create an account to use it.

I live in Oregon and we had horrible air quality last summer, in the unhealthy range repeatedly, even crossing into hazardous at times. With many wildfires burning across our region, we are all jumpy in fear of a repeat. For some reason, despite consistently good air this year, the  app predicts unhealthy air 4 hours in the future every single day. During the first week I cancelled a number of recreational and outdoor activity plans based on these predictions. I am especially peeved about one of these cancellations, something that I really wanted to do and lost some reservation money. I followed the site for another week\u2014same thing every day. I know air patterns and fire conditions can change rapidly but AirVisual was never correct. The forecast ability was the main draw for me so I deleted AirVisual and swapped it out for an app with a very simple design, just current AQ numbers in bubbles on a map, easy to navigate around a region."},

The iq air quality monitor makes this app even better by providing different recommendations to improve your specific indoor AQi and when necessary, recommendations for keeping outdoor air out by closing windows, etc. This app, however, provides far more information than the iq aqi monitor alone so have more information available to compare current aqi with historical trends as well as current aqi in other cities you may be considering for future travels. I\u2019ve recently changed the destination of our summer vacation based on the aqi information provided for Indonesia. I don\u2019t want to expose our child to the air pollution for such an extended period of time. It really is very enlightening information to have at your fingertips. I really wish the CA school systems actively used this data available on the app at the very least, and at best both the aqi monitoring devices with the app to make more informed decisions about outdoor activities and when its best to limit young children and sensitive students to indoor activities to avoid exposure to the outdoor air pollution when aqi data is highest indicating poor air quality. The aqi data monitor could also help schools assess individual school locations and any need for improved ventilation or air purification systems within specific schools and/or districts. Thank you for making this data publicly accessible for all! Air quality is so important and often an overlooked space when assessing cause and effect with concerning health issues. I think this information being public can only  help encourage all countries to make improving air quality a priority. I hope more people start accessing and using this information to help guide their travels where the air is clean and safe for all, as well as encourage all of us to continue making efforts to improve our air quality and reduce air pollution starting with our own home energy usage. Please keep advancing research and technology! It is greatly appreciated!"},

So the forecast could say 51-100 (yellow) for several three hour makes through the day and the current reading will be 155 (red). They don't even update the trajectory forecast before you pass the time mark and it disappears from the timeline."},

I have verified the in-home pm2.5, temp, and humidity readings with other monitors. Maintains a clear and useful history by day, hour and moth, easy to read. Includes external community monitoring station results. Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, the latter is always 2 hours older than the continuous internal monitoring of the node. Therefore one cannot make clear inferences regarding the source of in-home contamination from the data displayed on the Node alone. Fortunately, EPA has an app, AirNow, that provides local outside AQI (by zip code) that is an hour or less old. This supplements the node and gives better perspective on relative AQI, without having to take the node outdoors every time one wants to compare. My Node went on the fritz once in February. Several calls to the company resulted in learning that the pm2.5 sensor can occasionally get a particle lodged inside that blocks its continuous monitoring ability. They informed me that this is easily corrected by a blast or two from a can of  compressed air. It worked, and the problem has not recurred in the approximately 5 months I have been using the Node."},

I also got sick of checking aqicn.org when I needed an air quality update. The reason I say it has potential is that until recently it's worked flawlessly. For the last 24 hrs it's been un-updated. I'm currently residing in Sasebo Japan, where it turns out they don't inform you before you arrive, you get tons of crappy pollution from China in the form of PM 2.5. I have a 9 mos old son and a 5 yr old I'm trying to keep from developing childhood asthma. That's why air quality is so important to me. Hope they can work out the bugs!!"}
