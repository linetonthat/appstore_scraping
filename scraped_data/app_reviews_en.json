Awful to see the country I live in has removed the app from its domestic app stores while leading a campaign to discredit the horrific readings it relays simply because polluting the air is how companies (and governments) make short-term profits.\n\nIt seems we have entered an age of anti science, where the most ignorant minds feel legitimized in overlooking the work and the warnings of the most intelligent, simply because what they\u2019re seeing and reading doesn\u2019t match their own blinkered agenda.\n\nDownload this app, tell your friends to download this app, share the information and never lose sight of how bad the situation really is. If not for you, do it for your kids."},

We love the stove and use it a lot in the evenings. \nIt burns very cleanly so I was wondering if particulates are escaping when the door is opened to add wood.\nThe monitor showed that the problem is just when the kindling is lit and the door has to be left slightly ajar. As soon as the stove reaches temperature there are no more peaks to purple even with the door opened.\nI now wear a mask when lighting the stove until the air quality improves ( 5-10 mins with ventilation) and am considering buying an IQ air purifier. \nOther helpful info was a rise to red when cooking on the hob including an increased humidity reading in the house. This was rectified by cleaning the extractor hood filters.\nThe high C02 readings when all the family was in one room has led us to ventilate the house more and this really improves air quality as seen by the green readings.\n\nAll in all a very useful purchase-easy to set up and use and great for anyone with allergies to see what may be triggering symptoms. \nHighly recommended."},
